# SNIIIF

Simple node IIIF server using koa and sharp. The only challenging part is mapping the syntax from the IIIF standard into calls into the sharp library. 

- [IIIF Standard](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#introduction)
- [Sharp Library](http://sharp.dimens.io/en/stable)

In addition to the IIIF spec this server also allows image upload from authenticated users.
